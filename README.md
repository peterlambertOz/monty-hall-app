## The Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser based on the game show "Let's Make a Deal":

1. You choose one of three doors
2. The host (Monty) opens one of the other doors, revealing a goat
3. You can keep your original choice or switch to the other unopened door

**The counterintuitive result:** Switching doors gives you a 2/3 (66.7%) chance of winning, while keeping your original choice only gives you a 1/3 (33.3%) chance!
